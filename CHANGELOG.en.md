# Changelog

English | [中文](./CHANGELOG.md)

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.25.14 latest]

### Fixed
- **OML nested object member silent drop**: fix nested `object` members (and following siblings) being silently dropped on parse failure while load still succeeded; `oml_map()` now verifies the body is fully consumed so an invalid member fails the whole OML; adds `pipe` member support (`NestedAccessor::Pipe`); target-list parsing tolerates whitespace around commas.
- **OML read/take arg silent drop**: fix invalid args inside `read(...)`/`take(...)` being silently ignored; the paren scope is now verified fully consumed and leftover content fails the whole OML.

## [0.25.13] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **`time_timestamp` parses `0` as Unix epoch**: fix `time_timestamp` field type rejecting the digit `0` (the parser required fixed 10/13/16-digit lengths). `0` now parses as Unix epoch (`1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`); 1–9 digit integers parse as seconds; 10/13/16-digit second/millisecond/microsecond behavior is unchanged; 11–12 digit values now fail cleanly instead of partially consuming.

## [0.25.12] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **OML/Time timestamp functions**: synced `wp-motor v1.25.4`; new `Time::from_ts`/`from_ts_ms`/`from_ts_us` (seconds/millis/micros → time), inverse of `to_ts`/`to_ts_ms`/`to_ts_us`; all six functions accept an optional `zone` (default UTC+8), with out-of-i32-range or `|zone| > 23` rejected at parse time and invalid zones falling through unchanged.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.25.3` → `v1.25.4` (incl. `wp-engine`/`wp-config`/`wp-cli-core`/`wp-proj`).

## [0.25.11] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **OML intranet enrichment**: synced `wp-motor v1.25.2`; new `intranet_ip` (LAN/WAN), `access_direct` (access direction), `on_fail` (fallback) functions; pipe-source extension supports `access_direct(a,b) | on_fail('x')`. Intranet networks are managed as knowledge by wp-knowledge (`knowdb.toml [intranet_nets]`), checkable via `wproj check`.
- **English short output**: `intranet_ip` → `LAN`/`WAN`, `access_direct` → `L2L`/`L2W`/`W2L`/`W2W` (L=LAN, W=WAN, 2=to).
- **OML nested objects & object arrays**: synced `wp-motor v1.25.3` (#346); `object { ... }` sub-values accept nested object literals; new `array { ... }` aggregate for object/value literal arrays; static blocks support nested object/array literals.

### Fixed
- **IPv4-mapped IPv6 parsing**: synced `wp-primitives 0.2.1`; fixes the WPL `ip` field mis-rejecting `::ffff:a.b.c.d` IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (previously such addresses fell into miss).

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.25.1` → `v1.25.3` (incl. `wp-engine`/`wp-config`/`wp-cli-core`/`wp-proj`), `wp-primitives` → `0.2.1`.

## [0.25.10] - 2026-08-05

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.23.8` → `v1.25.1` (incl. `wp-engine`/`wp-config`/`wp-cli-core`/`wp-proj`), aligning dependency versions: `wp-error` `0.10` → `0.11`, `wp-knowledge` `0.14` → `0.15` (fixes the `RunReason` type-conversion compile error caused by coexisting `wp-error` versions).

## [0.25.7] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Sink/Metadata**: Synced `wp-motor v1.23.6`; JSON/CSV sink group output now emits fixed runtime metadata fields `wp_stream_tag` and `wp_event_id` by default. Added group-level `sink_group.wp_meta_disable` to hide selected metadata fields, for example `["wp_stream_tag", "wp_event_id"]`.
- **Benchmarks**: Synced the `sink_wp_meta` benchmark coverage for metadata output and disable behavior.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.23.5` → `v1.23.6`.
- **Sink/Runtime**: Runtime metadata injection now happens once at the `SinkDispatcher`/sink_group boundary; single-owner records use `Arc::try_unwrap` to avoid unnecessary `DataRecord` clones.
- **Config/Sinks**: `stream_tag_field` is source-only and is rejected from sink/wpgen output params. `wp_meta_disable` is group-level only; connector-facing sink specs filter runtime-only metadata params before validate/build.

## [0.25.7] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.23.6` → `v1.23.7`
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-connectors` `v0.15.8` → `v0.17.0`

## [0.25.6] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-connectors` `v0.15.6` → `v0.15.8`

## [0.25.5] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **wpgen/Config**: `wpgen.toml` now supports `[models]` section with `wpl` field to specify WPL rule/sample directory, matching `wparse.toml` semantics. Priority: `--wpl` CLI > `[models].wpl` > default `./models/wpl/`. Invalid/empty directory causes startup error.
- **Connector/Validate**: `merge_params` / `merge_source_params` / `merge_params_with_allowlist` now perform parameter type validation (`json_type_label`). Config values with mismatched types (e.g. `port = "9801"` string overriding integer default) cause errors instead of silent fallback.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.23.4` → `v1.23.5`

### Fixed
- **wpgen**: `validate_wpl_dir` now recursively searches subdirectories for `.wpl` files (previously only scanned top-level, nested WPL rules were not validated)

## [0.25.4] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` `v1.23.3` → `v1.23.4`
  - `wpadm` toolchain (`data stat/validate/check`, `sources list/route`) supports directory-based source format (auto-scan `topology/sources/*.toml` when `wpsrc.toml` is absent)
  - Fixed clippy `collapsible_if` / `unused_imports` warnings
- **CLI**: Binary renamed `wproj` → `wpadm`; `wproj` kept as backward-compat symlink (`wproj → wpadm`)
  - `Dockerfile` / `setup.sh` / `release.yml` updated accordingly
  - `_gal/work.gxl` removed old `wproj` binary copy
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded major dependencies
  - `wp-motor`: `v1.22.6` → `v1.23.4`
    - Added Redis Knowledge Provider support (`knowdb.toml` → `[provider.redis]`)
    - Removed standalone `arrow-file` / `arrow-ipc` sink backends, unified into file/tcp sink
    - Upgraded `shadow-rs` 1.5 → 2.0, `wp-core-connectors` 0.3.3 → 0.5
    - Fixed `wproj init` template compatibility, `ip4_to_int` IPv6 handling, etc.
  - `wp-connectors`: `v0.14.2` → `v0.15.6`
  - `wp-knowledge`: `v0.13.0` → `v0.14.2`

## [0.24.11] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.8` to `v1.22.9`, syncing release tag / origin head resolution fixes and infrastructure updates.
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-lang` from `0.3.3` to `0.3.5`, syncing `kvarr_raw`, `kvarr` duplicate key lazy handling, parser-only performance benchmarks, and WPL doc updates.
- **Lockfile**: Refreshed transitive dependency versions in `Cargo.lock`.

### Fixed
- **Project Remote**: Fixed robustness in `project_remote` when resolving local tags, origin URLs, and remote HEAD targets, avoiding misjudgments or errors in certain Git states.

## [0.24.10] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.8` to `v1.22.9`, syncing sink batch success-path record ID overhead benchmarks and lightweight error log path adjustments.
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-lang` from `0.3.3` to `0.3.4`, syncing parser-only performance benchmark suite, empty pipe fast path, and quoted `chars` parse hot-path optimization.

## [0.24.9] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Source Rate Limit**: Synced upstream `wp-motor v1.22.7`, adding global source-side input rate limiting; `performance.rate_limit_rps = 0` enables auto rate-limiting, `> 0` sets a shared fixed EPS cap for all sources.
- **Memory Profiles**: Added unified memory profile support, controllable via `WP_MEMORY_PROFILE=standard|low|throughput` to tune runtime queues, watermarks, batch sizes, and network/file buffer memory parameters.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.6` to `v1.22.7`.
  - Default `performance.rate_limit_rps` changed from fixed value to `0` (auto).
  - Auto rate-limiting dynamically adjusts input rate based on picker pending watermark, parser backpressure, and RSS growth protection.
  - Source rate-limiting wait moved before entering pending, reducing pending/RSS inflation under rate-limited scenarios.
  - Benchmark `wparse.toml` uses `${RATE_LIMIT_RPS:0}`, benchmark scripts default to syncing wparse rate limit with input rate.
- **DebugView**: Debug output changed to bounded queue; records drop count and sample alerts when full, avoiding unbounded queue RSS growth.

## [0.24.8] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.4` to `v1.22.6`
  - Generator send path now uses dynamic batch sizing (`BatchSizePolicy`), `wpgen` CPU ~300% → ~15% on TCP sink
  - Fixed `wp-core-connectors` crate name references (hyphens → underscores)

## [0.24.7] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-lang` from `0.3.2` to `0.3.3`.

## [0.24.6] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Event ID**: Fixed `wp_event_id` issue to ensure correct event ID generation.

## [0.24.5] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-model-core` from `0.8.7` to `0.8.9`; upgraded `tokio` from `1.52.2` to `1.52.3`, `openssl` from `0.10.79` to `0.10.80`, `serde_json` from `1.0.149` to `1.0.150`, `aws-lc-rs` from `1.16.3` to `1.17.0`, `os_info` from `3.14.0` to `3.15.0`, and other transitive dependencies.

### Fixed

## [0.24.4] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.3` to `v1.22.4`, pulling in the `ip4_to_int` fix — added string IPv4 address parsing support, IPv6 addresses now return Null instead of silently passing through unchanged.

## [0.24.3] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **SQL/Route**: Added SQL query table-name routing to local SQLite or external Provider — supports `[[tables]]` and `[provider.tables]` configuration in `knowdb.toml`, automatically resolves table names from `FROM` clauses and dispatches queries.
- **KnowDB/Config**: Added `uses_external_provider_only()` check; pure external provider configurations no longer delete local authority files.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.2` to `v1.22.3`, pulling in SQL routing, KnowDB external Provider support, `sanitize_sql_body` sub-query and alias syntax enhancements, and related improvements.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Sinks/Sync**: Pulled in upstream `wp-motor` sink batch write methods (`send_to_sink_batch`, `try_send_to_sink_batch`) to reduce backpressure from excessive statistical slicing.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.1` to `v1.22.2`, bringing sink batch write capabilities.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **OML/SQL**: Pulled in upstream fix to skip unnecessary remote calls when all SQL parameters are Null.
- **OML/Extract**: Pulled in upstream fix so `SingleEvalExp` skips `Value::Null` when extracting fields, instead of creating target fields for null values.
- **OML/SQL**: Pulled in upstream knowledge base query bug fixes.

### Changed
- **Knowledge Base**: Pulled in upstream knowledge base query optimizations.
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.22.0` to `v1.22.1`, bringing OML/SQL query optimizations and knowledge base improvements.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **HTTP Source**: Added HTTP Source connector support (`http` feature), enabling data ingestion via HTTP.
- **Postgres Source**: Added Postgres Source feature inheritance support; low-version compatibility adaptation.
- **Project Remote**: Added dual-repo mode support (`[project_remote.models]` + `[project_remote.infra]`), allowing `models/` and `infra/` to sync independently from two separate Git repos via `--group models|infra`.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` from `v1.20.0` to `v1.22.0`, pulling in: `take()` field priority fix, SQL `IN (...)` parameter binding fix, error handling chain optimization, `WarpProject::load()` semantic restoration, `stable_code` bilingual error hints, and `orion-error 0.8` upgrade adaptation.
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-connectors` from `v0.12.1` to `v0.14.0` (added HTTP Source, PostgreSQL Source connectors); upgraded `orion` family (`orion-error 0.6.3→0.8`, `orion-sec 0.4→0.5`, `orion-variate 0.11→0.12`, `orion_conf 0.5→0.6`); upgraded internal API packages (`wp-connector-api 0.8→0.9`, `wp-log 0.2→0.3`, `wp-error 0.8→0.9`); upgraded `shadow-rs 1.6.0→2.0`.
- **Error Handling**: 全面升级错误治理体系 — `orion-error` 升级到 `0.8` 主线，错误信息附带路径上下文，CLI 报错更完整可读。
- **Admin API**: Added listen address configuration; reload endpoint now supports `group` parameter for dual-repo mode; status endpoint returns per-group version info in dual-repo mode.

### Fixed
- **OML/Take**: Pulled in upstream fixes so `take(...)` can consume fields already produced in the target record and uses the correct priority when target and source records share field names.
- **OML/SQL Parser**: Pulled in upstream fixes for SQL parameter parsing around `group_concat(...)`, `string_agg(...)`, `IN (...)`, `take(field)`, and `__temp_var`.
- Fixed runtime stability issues in certain scenarios.

## [0.22.5 ]

### Changed
- **wproj/Check**: Significantly improved validation depth and breadth — added `wpgen` config checks (`output.connect`, `rule_root`, `sample_pattern`, `logging.file_path`); semantic-dict now validates empty words / duplicates / empty categories; missing source/sink directories, source files, and GLOB mismatches downgraded to warnings.
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` to `v1.20.7`, bringing `wproj check` enhancements and validation chain improvements.
- **CLI Errors**: Unified `-q/--quiet` argument handling, improving quiet-mode diagnostics.

### Fixed

- **wpgen/Schema**: Rejected missing `output.connect`; removed deprecated `mode` / `duration_secs` from examples.
- **wpgen/Level**: Supported compound log level format (e.g., `info,ctrl=info`).
- **Config/Panic**: Fixed panic when engine config contains unknown TOML fields (`with_source` → `with_struct_source`).
- **Project Loading**: wpgen.toml no longer blocks project loading when absent.
- **OML/WPL Lint**: Extra semantic checks changed to non-blocking lint.


## [0.22.4] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` to `v1.20.6`, pulling in upstream improvements; upgraded `wp-knowledge` from `0.11.4` to `0.11.6`, improving MySQL/PostgreSQL knowledge-base connection stability and field type compatibility (added `BYTEA`, `ENUM`, `UUID` support etc.), with fine-grained connection pool configuration.

### Fixed
- **Security**: Fixed a potential panic in `load_sec_dict` caused by mismatched error types (`with_std_source` → `with_struct_source`), ensuring sec_key loading failures are reported gracefully instead of crashing.

### Added
- **Audit**: Added `.cargo/audit.toml` to ignore RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa crate Marvin Attack timing side-channel — only affects loopback TLS which is disabled by default; low real-world risk, scheduled for re-evaluation on 2026-07-25).


## [0.22.3] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded `wp-motor` to `v1.20.5`, bringing stability improvements to diagnostics, config loading, and project-management flows.
- **Admin API**: Switched Admin API and client profile loading to the core engine config loader, reusing the standard environment and path resolution semantics.
- **CLI Errors**: Further unified error messages across `wparse`, `wpgen`, `wproj`, and `wprescue`; failures now preserve the main reason, related paths, and upstream clues more consistently so issues are easier to diagnose.
- **Project Management UX**: Further aligned error output across config loading, project remote operations, and project-management commands so similar failures are reported more consistently instead of being overly short in some paths and overly verbose in others.

### Fixed
- **wproj/Engine**: Improved error reporting for engine status/reload requests, token loading, header construction, and response decoding so failures surface more complete reasons instead of only a short failure message.
- **wproj/Conf Update**: Fixed overly short validation errors after config updates; validation failures now show a more complete chain so the actual failure point is easier to locate.
- **Project Remote**: Fixed error-chain handling in some remote project sync and state-persistence failure paths, avoiding cases where errors could be rewrapped incorrectly, lose useful details, or behave inconsistently.

## [0.22.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **CLI Usage Docs**: Added tool-specific CLI documentation for `wparse`, `wpgen`, `wproj`, and `wprescue`, plus a shared index that maps common local-development, operations, and rescue workflows.
- **Operations/Overview Docs**: Added the new `overview/` and `operations/` documentation structure, including reorganized product overview, runtime admin usage, and remote project sync / hot reload SOP pages.

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded remote `wp-motor` dependencies from `v1.20.0` to `v1.20.1`, and upgraded `wp-connectors` from `v0.12.1` to `v0.12.2`.
- **Victoria Templates**: Updated the Docker default sink connector templates for `victorialogs` and `victoriametrics` so their IDs, parameter names, and default endpoints match the latest connector definitions and use host-reachable `127.0.0.1` addresses.
- **Docs Layout**: Reorganized user-facing docs into `overview/`, `cli/`, and `operations/` sections; moved the runtime admin and remote project sync guides to the new paths and added fresh Chinese/English navigation pages.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Self Update**: Added an install-capable `wproj self update` flow and a dedicated `warp-self-update` crate that centralizes manifest resolution, version comparison, asset download, installation, and rollback logic; supports `sha256` verification, rollback on failed health checks, and control flags such as `--yes`, `--dry-run`, and `--force`.
- **Admin API Dev Docs**: Added a standalone Admin API development guide covering `GET /admin/v1/runtime/status`, `POST /admin/v1/reloads/model`, request/response schemas, status codes, conflict handling, and `update/version` semantics.
- **Runtime Status**: Added `project_version` to Admin API `GET /admin/v1/runtime/status` and `wproj engine status` so callers can see which project configuration version is currently active in the work tree.
- **Reload Runtime**: Added structured reload results, event-driven drain, and the `reload_timeout_ms` configuration capability through the core engine upgrade.
- **OML Async Runtime**: Moved model loading and knowledge-backed queries onto async execution paths through the core engine and knowledge runtime upgrades.
- **Knowledge Runtime**: Added PostgreSQL and MySQL knowledge support, plus unified cache behavior and telemetry.
- **wproj/model**: Added the async OML model collection path to `wproj model route`.
- **Observability**: Added fixed metric labels and unified tag naming so monitoring systems can consume runtime metrics more consistently.
- **wp-connectors**: Pulled in VictoriaMetrics-related capability updates.
- **wp-lang**: Added `json_like` support.

### Changed
- **Remote Project Sync**: Standardized remote bootstrap on `wproj init --repo <REPO> [--version <VERSION>]`, removed `--remote`, and changed version resolution so flows without an explicit `--version` prefer the latest release tag and fall back to the remote default branch `HEAD` when no release tags exist. It also aligns parameter handling plus help and status output across `wproj conf update` and admin reload/update flows.
- **CLI/Paths**: Shortened source, sink, and rescue-related table output to a consistent relative-path style for better terminal readability.

### Fixed
- **Project Init Admin Token Path**: Fixed `wproj init` so that when the generated skeleton already contains `[admin_api]`, it normalizes the token path to project-local `runtime/admin_api.token` instead of preserving legacy `${HOME}/.warp_parse/admin_api.token`.

## [0.20.2]

### Fixed
- **orion-sec**: Updated `orion-sec` to keep `sec_key` handling consistent.

## [0.20.1]

### Fixed
- **Event ID**: Pulled in upstream `wp-motor` fixes to unify `wp_event_id` generation and avoid duplicate IDs after runtime restarts.
- **Kafka Source**: Pulled in the upstream `wp-connectors` fix so Kafka source events use the shared `wp_event_id` generator instead of a process-local counter.

## [0.20.0]

### Added
- Added HTTP sink support.
- Added Elasticsearch sink support.
- Added Postgres sink support.
- Added Doris sink support.
- Added ClickHouse sink support.

### Changed
- **wp-motor**: Upgraded core engine dependency from `v1.17.8` to `v1.18.0`.
- **Dependencies**: Migrated core dependency stack to newer major lines (`orion-error 0.6`, `wp-connector-api 0.8`, `wp-error 0.8`, `wp-log 0.2`, etc.).
- **Dependencies**: Pulled in additional dependency refreshes such as `rand 0.10` and `toml 1.0`.
- **Runtime Connectors**: Temporarily skipped community external connector factory registration with warning logs to avoid API mismatch during dependency transition.

### Fixed
- **Error Handling**: Adapted to `orion-error 0.6` (`UvsFrom`/`from_*`) and unified error-context attachment behavior.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine from v1.17.5 to v1.17.6
- `wp-motor` v1.17.6 mainly improves observability and statistics (backpressure metrics, aggregation semantics fixes, hot-path optimization), and fixes parser shutdown and recovery failover stability

## [0.18.3] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine from v1.17.4-alpha to v1.17.5-alpha
- Upgraded `wp-connectors` from v0.7.7-beta to v0.7.8-beta

## [0.18.2] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine from v1.17.0-alpha to v1.17.4-alpha with key improvements:
  - **Sinks/Buffer**: Added sink-level batch buffer with configurable `batch_size` parameter; small packages enter pending buffer for periodic flushing, large packages automatically bypass for direct sending (zero-copy)
  - **Sinks/Config**: Added `batch_timeout_ms` configuration (default 300ms) to control periodic buffer flush interval
  - **Sinks/File**: Removed `BufWriter` and `proc_cnt` periodic flush, now writes directly to `tokio::fs::File`; upstream batch assembly makes userspace buffering redundant
- Upgraded `wp-connectors` from v0.7.6-beta to v0.7.7-beta with the following changes:
  - **Doris**: Use the new protocol
  - Updated `reqwest` from 0.12 to 0.13

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine from v1.15.5 to v1.17.0-alpha with key improvements:
  - **OML Match**: Added OR condition syntax `cond1 | cond2 | ...` for match expressions, supporting single-source and multi-source matching, compatible with both value and function matching
  - **OML Match**: Multi-source match now supports any number of source fields (no longer limited to 2/3/4)
  - **OML NLP**: Added `extract_main_word` and `extract_subject_object` pipe functions for Chinese text analysis
  - **OML NLP**: Added configurable NLP dictionary system, supporting custom dictionary via `NLP_DICT_CONFIG` environment variable
  - **WPL Features**: Added separator pattern syntax `{…}` with wildcards (`*`, `?`), whitespace matchers (`\s`, `\h`, `\S`, `\H`) and preserve groups `(…)` for expressing complex separator logic in a single declaration
  - **Bug Fixes**: Fixed kvarr pattern separator parsing

- Updated project dependencies to latest versions

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine to v1.15.1 with the following key changes:
  - **WPL Features**: Added `not()` wrapper function for inverting pipe function results
  - **WPL Features**: Added `not()` group wrapper for negative assertion in field parsing
  - **OML Features**: Introduced `static { ... }` sections for model-scoped constants and template caching to improve performance
  - **OML Configuration**: Added `enable` configuration option to support disabling OML models
  - **Sinks/File**: Added `sync` parameter to control disk flushing strategy (high-performance mode vs data safety mode)
  - **Sinks/File**: Removed proto binary format support; supported formats: json, csv, kv, show, raw, proto-text
  - **Bug Fixes**: Fixed `sync` parameter not forcing data to disk
  - **Bug Fixes**: Fixed type checking bug in WPL pipe functions `f_chars_not_has` and `chars_not_has`
- Updated project dependencies to latest versions

## [0.16.1] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- Upgraded `wp-motor` core engine to v1.14.1-alpha with the following key changes:
  - **WPL Pipe Processor**: Added `strip/bom` processor for removing BOM (Byte Order Mark) from data
    - Supports UTF-8, UTF-16 LE/BE, and UTF-32 LE/BE BOM detection and removal
    - Fast O(1) detection by checking only first 2-4 bytes
    - Preserves input container type (String → String, Bytes → Bytes, ArcBytes → ArcBytes)

[0.13.1]: https://github.com/wp-labs/warp-parse/releases/tag/v0.13.1

## [0.13.0] - 2024-05-09

> :information_source: This release follows the [wp-engine v1.8.0 changelog](https://github.com/wp-labs/wp-engine/releases/tag/v1.8.0). Changes on the CLI side primarily adapt to the core engine API updates. We recommend reading the engine release notes to understand runtime behavior differences.

### Added
- New **Field Pipe** design document (`docs/field-pipe-design.md`) explaining the execution model after splitting field collection pipes and single-field pipes, helping users understand how selectors like `take/last/@key` work with functions like `base64_decode`.
- `wproj` data, statistics, and validation subcommands now automatically load the security dictionary (`EnvDict`), providing access to secrets, variables, and other runtime configurations without manual setup.

### Changed
- Unified handling of `-q/--quiet` flags across `wproj`, `wparse`, and `wprescue` CLI tools using `wp_cli_core::split_quiet_args`, with consistent runtime feature registration for quiet mode and plugin loading.
- Migrated to `wp_cli_core` implementation for sink/source statistics and validation: `stat`/`validate` output now uses core library formatting, route/OML display aligns with the engine; `wpgen rule` direct execution also passes runtime variables to the engine layer.
- Updated dependencies in template `_gal/tpl/Cargo.toml` and main `Cargo.toml`, removing deprecated `wp-cli-utils` and directly referencing `wp-cli-core` for the latest CLI capabilities.

### Fixed
- Adapted to `wp-engine` v1.8.0 API changes where functions like `WarpProject::init/load`, `load_warp_engine_confs`, and `collect_oml_models` now require explicit `EnvDict` parameters. Resolved multiple compilation errors and improved runtime configuration consistency.
- Fixed statistics/validation commands crashing due to type mismatches with `wp-cli-core` in non-JSON mode. Now consistently converts to core library format for proper output.
